# Individual Projects!

## Personal Website (React.js)

It's this website! You're already here!

[The GitHub repo](https://github.com/james168ma/personal-website).

## supreme-bot (Python)

A webscraping tool that automates purchases for Supreme, especially for hyped items or
multiple item purchases.

If you want to try it out, check out [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/james168ma/supreme-bot).

## ebay-view-bot (Python)

A webscraping tool that boosts your views for items that you post on ebay. Super simple
setup and works great!

If you want to try it out, check out [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/james168ma/ebay-view-bot).

## comments-demo (React.js)

![Comments-Demo Website](/images/comments-demo.png)

A website that is a proof of concept for making a working comments section with AWS
DynamoDB. I programmed the entire back end and used boostrap on the front end. On every
request for the website, I send a request to AWS DynamoDB's API to fetch my comments and the
data that comes with it. When a user posts a comment, another request is sent to the
AWS API to update the database with the new comment.

[Try it out here!](https://comments-demo.vercel.app/)

Please don't comment anything offensive, because I'll have to manually remove it from
the database and that'll be a pain.

The GitHub repo is private because it contains information about my AWS key.

## make-rand-file (Python)

A cool command line tool that I whipped up myself. It takes some arguments and
spits out a random file of bytes that fit those arguments.

If you want to try it out, check out [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/james168ma/make-rand-file).
