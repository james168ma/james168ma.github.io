# Individual Projects!

I am still in the process of buffing up this part of my project portfolio, as I don't
have that many projects that I've just made on my own yet, but I'm proud of the few
that I have.

## Personal Website (React.js)

It's this website! You're already here!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/personal-website).

## supreme-bot (Python)

A webscraping tool that automates purchases for Supreme, especially for hyped items or
multiple item purchases.

If you whant to try it out, check out my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/supreme-bot).

## make-rand-file (Python)

A cool command line tool that I whipped up myself. It takes some arguments and
spits out a random file of bytes that fit those arguments.

If you want to try it out, check out my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/make-rand-file).
