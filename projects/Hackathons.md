The project I made with my team during [YHack 2020](https://yhack2020.devpost.com/).

I talk about it in detail in [this blog post](/subpages/Blog/YHack2020).

## Meteor Metronome (Unity + C#)

As the project that I contributed to during my first Hackathon, I'm pretty proud of
it. It's based off the classic Asteroids game with an added twist of rhythm,
where the player can only shoot on the beat of a drum. It won Best Game
at the hackathon ([HOTH7](https://hoth7.devpost.com/))!
