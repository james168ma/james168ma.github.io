# Hackathon Projects!

So, as of June 2020, I've been to a grand total of **one** hackathon. Okay, I know, I'm
a newbie to this kind of stuff but at least I was able to learn some new skills and
help my team win the prize for the best game.

## Meteor Metronome (Unity + C#)

As the project that I contributed to during my first Hackathon, I'm pretty proud of
it. It's based off the classic Asteroids game with an added twist of rhythm,
where the player can only shoot on the beat of a drum. It won Best Game
at the hackathon ([HOTH7](https://hoth7.devpost.com/))!
