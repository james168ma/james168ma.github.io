{"pageProps":{"id":"APCS","contentHtml":"<h1>APCS Projects!</h1>\n<p>Unlike my UCLA projects, these all are public so you can try them out for yourself!</p>\n<p>Also, I made these in high school, so set your expectations <del>low</del> accordingly.</p>\n<h2>Asteroids (Java)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/AsteroidsGame.png\" alt=\"Asteroids gameplay.\"></p>\n<p>Yes, my high school computer science class had us make Asteroids as a project. Cool\nright? The project is based off the original Asteroids, where the player gets to\ncontrol a spaceship and shoot asteroids. I added levels: the first one, where the player\nhas to eliminate all the asteroids; the second one, where the player has to eliminate\nseveral enemy ships; and the third one, where the player has to eliminate the boss.</p>\n<p>Play it <a href=\"https://james168ma.github.io/AsteroidsGame/\">here</a>!</p>\n<p><em>Hint: just press 'w' and the spacebar for the first level.</em></p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/james168ma/AsteroidsGame\">repo</a>.</p>\n<h2>Chemotaxis (Java)</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Chemotaxis.png\" alt=\"Chemotaxis start screen.\"></p>\n<p>Originally this project was supposed to be one where you animated bacteria that\nmoved around with random walks (hence the name). I spun it off into a game where\nthe player targets enemy (red) dots and kills them before the enemy dots kill off the\nfriendly (colorful) dots.</p>\n<p>Play it <a href=\"https://james168ma.github.io/Chemotaxis/\">here</a>!</p>\n<p><em>Be warned: there are</em> <strong><em>many</em></strong> <em>flashing lights.</em></p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/james168ma/Chemotaxis\">repo</a>.</p>\n<h2>The rest of my APCS projects (also in Java)</h2>\n<p>The rest of my high school CS projects are not really worth writing a whole feature\nfor them, so I'll just list them here and give a little explanation for each.</p>\n<h3>Minesweeper</h3>\n<p>The name basically describes it.</p>\n<p>Play it <a href=\"https://james168ma.github.io/Minesweeper/\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/james168ma/Minesweeper\">repo</a>.</p>\n<h3>Fractal Tree</h3>\n<p>A tree image that is randomly generated using skewed fractals and recursion.</p>\n<p>Look at it <a href=\"https://james168ma.github.io/FractalTree/\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/james168ma/FractalTree\">repo</a>.</p>\n<h3>Original Fractal</h3>\n<p>A cool recursive design that follows your mouse (within a certain range).</p>\n<p>Try it out <a href=\"https://james168ma.github.io/OriginalFractal/\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/james168ma/OriginalFractal\">repo</a>.</p>\n<h3>Sierpinski Triangle</h3>\n<p>A Sierpinski Triangle made using recursion.</p>\n<p>Look at it <a href=\"https://james168ma.github.io/SierpinskiTriangle/\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/james168ma/SierpinskiTriangle\">repo</a>.</p>\n<h3>Starfield</h3>\n<p>A program that shoots a firework when you click on it.
