{"pageProps":{"id":"About","contentHtml":"<h1>A Little About Me</h1>\n<p><em>Hi there!</em></p>\n<p>I'm James Ma, and I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCLA\nstudying Computer Science. I decided to learn some React because I had nothing\nto do while I was quarantined during the summer of 2020. The result is this\npersonal website thingy I've built, mostly for fun but, I guess it could go on\nmy resume (*ahem* recruiters please notice me).</p>\n<p>As of June 2020, I'm interested in learning more about full-stack development\nbecause building the front end of this website was fun (we'll see about the back\nend). I also really want to learn game development with Unity, so maybe I'll post\none of my Unity projects here one day.</p>\n<h1>A Little About this Website</h1>\n<p>I think this website will mostly be a place for me to show off some of the projects\nI've made over the years. I might add a blog in too if I feel like it. I'll <del>probably</del>\nhopefully keep it updated often.</p>\n","ids":["About","Individual","Hackathons","UCLA","APCS"],"data":{"title":"About Me","priority":0}},"__N_SSG":true}
