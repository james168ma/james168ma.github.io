# A Little About Me

*Hi there!*

I'm James Ma, and I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCLA
studying Computer Science. I decided to learn some React because I had nothing
to do while I was quarantined during the summer of 2020. The result is this
personal website thingy I've built, mostly for fun but, I guess it could go on
my resume (\*ahem\* recruiters please notice me).

As of June 2020, I'm interested in learning more about full-stack development
because building the front end of this website was fun (we'll see about the back
end). I also really want to learn game development with Unity, so maybe I'll post
one of my Unity projects here one day.

# A Little About this Website

I think this website will mostly be a place for me to show off some of the projects
I've made over the years. I added a blog in too because I felt like it. I'll ~~probably~~
hopefully keep it updated often.
