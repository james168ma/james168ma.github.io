# A Little About Me

*Hi there!*

I'm James Ma, and I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCLA
studying Computer Science. I decided to learn some React because I had nothing
to do while I was quarantined during the summer of 2020. The result is this
personal website I've built, mostly for fun but also for my resume.

As of November 2020, I'm fully buried in CS homework and very little time
on my hands to work on my own projects (although I do make time to do so occasionally).
However, I'm still always open to learning through building, and hopefully I will
get some more time to work the [multiplayer FPS](https://github.com/james168ma/Simpleton) 
game that I started building using Unity.


# A Little About this Website

I think this website will mostly be a place for me to show off some of the projects
I've made over the years. I added a blog in too because I felt like it. I'll ~~probably~~
hopefully keep it updated often.

# What I'm Working On

Right now I'm working on a multiplay FPS game called [Simpleton](https://github.com/james168ma/Simpleton). 
It's built with Unity.
