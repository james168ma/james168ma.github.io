# A Little About Me

*Hi there!*

I'm James Ma, and I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCLA
studying Computer Science. I decided to learn some React because I had nothing
to do while I was quarantined during the summer of 2020. The result is this
personal website I've built, mostly for fun but also for my resume.

As of July 2020, I'm interested in learning more about full-stack development
because building the front end of this website and tinkering with an AWS backend
on a [different project](https://comments-demo.vercel.app/) was fun. I also really want to learn game development with
Unity, so maybe I'll post one of my Unity projects here one day. Recently, I've come
up with the idea for an app that will let you set reminders, but the reminders will
be rude in a funny way. It'll be a good way to get me into mobile development.

# A Little About this Website

I think this website will mostly be a place for me to show off some of the projects
I've made over the years. I added a blog in too because I felt like it. I'll ~~probably~~
hopefully keep it updated often.

# What I'm Working On

Right now I'm taking a small break from programming projects. Of course, I'm still doing
LeetCode though.
