# Individual Projects!

I am still in the process of buffing up this part of my project portfolio, as I don't
have that many projects that I've just made on my own yet, but I'm proud of the few
that I have.

## james168ma.github.io (React.js)

It's this website! You're already here! I'm too lazy to write a description because
you can explore it yourself.

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/james168ma.github.io).

## makeRandFile (Python3)

A cool command line tool that I whipped up myself. It takes some arguments and
spits out a random file of bytes that fit those arguments.

If you want to try it out, check out my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/makeRandFile)!
