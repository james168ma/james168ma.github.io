# UCLA CS Projects!

As a forewarning, most of these will be private repositories because they were
solutions to class projects.

## Kontagion (C++)

This was project 3 of CS32 (basically a data structures and algorithms course). In
it, the player has control of the ship at the rim of the petri dish (*yes, the circle
is a petri dish*). With that ship, the player must take out all the bacteria before
advancing to the next level. Along the way, the player can pick up upgrades or downgrades
(fungi).

It's basically impossible to get past the fourth level :)

Unfortunately, the GitHub repo is private :(

## GooberEats (C++)

*please disregard the questionable copyright infringement on the name of the project*

This was project 4 of CS32. Given a list of latitude and longitude pairs, streetnames,
a depot, and destinations, GooberEats can give you an approximate best route using
the A* and nearest neighbor algorithms.

It assumes that all streets are two way streets, so it won't actually work in real life,
but it was fun making it.

Unfortunately again, the GitHub repo is private :(
