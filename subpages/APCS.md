# APCS Projects!

Unlike my UCLA projects, these all are public so you can try them out for yourself!

Also, I made these in high school, so set your expectations ~~low~~ accordingly.

## Asteroids (Java)

![Asteroids gameplay.](/images/AsteroidsGame.png)

Yes, my high school computer science class had us make Asteroids as a project. Cool
right? The project is based off the original Asteroids, where the player gets to
control a spaceship and shoot asteroids. I added levels: the first one, where the player
has to eliminate all the asteroids; the second one, where the player has to eliminate
several enemy ships; and the third one, where the player has to eliminate the boss.

Play it [here](https://james168ma.github.io/AsteroidsGame/)!

*Hint: just press 'w' and the spacebar for the first level.*

## Chemotaxis (Java)

![Chemotaxis start screen.](/images/Chemotaxis.png)

Originally this project was supposed to be one where you animated bacteria that
moved around with random walks (hence the name). I spun it off into a game where
the player targets enemy (red) dots and kills them before the enemy dots kill off the
friendly (colorful) dots.

Play it [here](https://james168ma.github.io/Chemotaxis/)!

*Be warned: there are* ***many*** *flashing lights.*

## The rest of my APCS projects (also in Java)

The rest of my high school CS projects are not really worth writing a whole feature
for them, so I'll just list them here and give a little explanation for each.

### Minesweeper

The name basically describes it.

Play it [here](https://james168ma.github.io/Minesweeper/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/Minesweeper).

### Fractal Tree

A tree image that is randomly generated using skewed fractals and recursion.

Look at it [here](https://james168ma.github.io/FractalTree/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/FractalTree).

### Original Fractal

A cool recursive design that follows your mouse (within a certain range).

Try it out [here](https://james168ma.github.io/OriginalFractal/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/OriginalFractal).

### Sierpinski Triangle

A Sierpinski Triangle made using recursion.

Look at it [here](https://james168ma.github.io/SierpinskiTriangle/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/SierpinskiTriangle).

### Starfield

A program that shoots a firework when you click on it. This one looks really cool.

Try it out [here](https://james168ma.github.io/Starfield/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/Starfield).

### Dice

A program that rolls many dice (that's plural right?) and shows you the statistics.

Try it out [here](https://james168ma.github.io/Dice/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/Dice).

### Lightning

A program that displays rainbow(?) lightning. (I, too, question my design choices)

Look at it [here](https://james168ma.github.io/Lightning/)!

The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/james168ma/Lightning).

### Original Design

An infinite loading splash screen. It looks pretty satisfying, but you'll get fustrated
if you look too long.
