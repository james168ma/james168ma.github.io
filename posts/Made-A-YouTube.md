### So I made my first YouTube video...

I'm actually pretty proud of it, considering I didn't know anything about the Adobe
suite until around 5 days ago.

In order to learn how to make my video, I first tried out the Adobe Premier Pro
tutorial, which helped me familiarize myself with the software. After the beginner
tutorials, which took me about 30 minutes to complete, I did what I normally do to
learn: watch YouTube videos. I found this [really handy one](https://youtu.be/D5H6wdrB7e0) about how to edit a funny
gaming video, which was basically what I was going for.

After about 8 hours of watching more tutorials, googling stuff that I didn't know,
and just tinkering around -- *you know, typical programmer stuff* -- I finally finished
making a watchable (in my eyes) video. So, I exported the video and uploaded it to YouTube!

*But*, before I clicked the post button, I realized I had forgot one thing that all
successful YouTube videos have: a thumbnail.

So, again, I went on a hunt to find a YouTube video that could guide me to make a great
thumbnail, and I found [one that was amazing](https://youtu.be/GYgstWsjDB8). After
watching that video and learning some more about Photoshop, I was able to make a cool
thumbnail in about 1 to 2 hours.
