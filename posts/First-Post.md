### Well, it looks like I've finally finished procrastinating.

I finished this website a month ago.

Well, I *basically* finished it a month ago.

I was "learning" how to connect AWS's DynamoDB to my website in order to display
comments on my blog posts to allow random people to comment on how bad my
writing is. But, after learning it and testing it out on a [proof of concept webpage](https://comments-demo.vercel.app/), I got sidetracked by LeetCode.

Then, after spending two weeks on LeetCode, I finally got back to trying to get
comments on this website. And of course, after a month, I find out that my dynamic
statically generated pages that I make in Next.js with `getStaticPaths` and
`getStaticProps` can't be combined with server side generation (`getServerSideProps`).
This basically makes it impossible for me to get comments on my blog posts unless
I majorly change the design of the code for my website. I'm too lazy to do that, and this website
already looks pretty good.

And so, here I am, writing this post to vent.

Hope you have a nice day,

*A sincerely disappointed James*
